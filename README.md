# XandO

A single player x and o game written in python with a browser based frontend

### Backend
- written in python -> flask
  just recieves get requests with the player move added as a parameter and responds with an updated state array
- backtracking algorithm based on minimax game throry to calculate computer response

### Frontend
- written in HTML, CSS and vanilla javascript 

__disclaimer:__ there are a million easier and more practical ways to give your python project a UI than to host an api using flask and fetching the requests in a seperate webpage. I just did this out of curiosity.

work in progress . . .
